One of my new years resolutions was to write more blog posts. I placed a conservative (to me) goal
 of writing at least 1 blog post per month. Somewhat of an arbitrary milestone, but since my goal
was to place my thoughts out into the world and create more technical content I thought it would be
a good place to start. I broke my resolution after the second month.

See, it can be hard to know what to write about if you are unsure whether the content that you are
writing has been written by someone else, or you don't think of it as particularly original. I sure
don't think I'm (currently) and innovator, but I'd like to think I could one day become one. The
impostor syndrome can be strong sometimes and I have to admit I haven't boasted of excessive
confidence throughout my life. However I have come to the conclusion I am not the one to judge
whether I something I write is worth reading, someone else will have to be the judge of that. I can
only judge whether something is worth writing.

# Learning something new
I did not take a computer architecture course in college. Going to a liberal arts college has had
its advantages, but I always thought there was something missing in my fundamental understanding of
how computer worked from the ground up, including the hardware that made them work. I had heard
through a certain technical forum on the web that there was a book with and adjacent course called
[Nand2Tetris][nand2tetris] that was meant to teach the reader how did computers work under the hood, starting from
the basic hardware logic gates. I bought it sometime ago meaning to read it, but it started getting
dust in my shelf. A couple of weeks ago after reading a twitter post of someone in the
information security community recommending it I decided to give it a try. While I have only finished my
first chapter I have to say it is great. There is so much detail and the exercises included
really help you understand the material (if only math textbooks were as thorough!). 

The entire Nand2Tetris course is at least a semester long course, and today is the last day of
March. I hope I can finish the course by August, but we'll see how I do. My goal is to learn a lot
and have fun along the way. That is all I've got for now, wish me luck!
