If you ever run a blog, some of the posts have to be about your life. It is almost required.
Today I decided to share my latest adventure.

As the title of the page suggests, I moved west. Ever since I moved from Mexico to the US I've
lived in the East Coast, but today I took a one way ticket to San Francisco, hoping to work
in the technology industry. Some initial thoughts:

* This city is expensive
* I almost got scammed through craigslist 5 minutes ago
* Spending the summer in the southern US has spoiled me, and 60 F is now slightly chilly

I honestly can't say what is next, since I got out of the airport with one suitcase, a backpack
and a positive frame of mind. I just hope this city doesn't dissappoint, and I get to be part
of something that makes an impact on people's lives.

I feel the song below is appropiate. That's all folks.
