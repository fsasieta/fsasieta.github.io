# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

    My name is Franco; I am a recent graduate from Bowdoin College
    and I am looking to break into the technology industry. This is
    my first time with anything web based, so feel free to take a look
    around.
#Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
#line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
#Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
# (the previous paragraph left there in case I ever need it.)

baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://example.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
