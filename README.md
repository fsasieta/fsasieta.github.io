## Personal Website

This website is done using github's Jekyll. It is a [project](jekyllrb.com) made to build static websites.
I decided to use this and get free hosting instead of paying for a Database instance. It gives good web
development practice as well. 

Currently the site can be accessed by the link [francosasieta.com](francosasieta.com), [www.francosasieta.com](www.francosasieta.com), [fsasieta.github.io](fsasieta.github.io). They are all the same, except the last two use github's CDN which makes them load faster. It is on my TODO list.
