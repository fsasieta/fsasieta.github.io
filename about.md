Born in Mexico City, raised in Cancun and graduated from [Bowdoin College][bowdoin].

I have professional experience with Scala and breathe functional programming in my day to day job.
In my spare time you will see me dabble in IoT and hardware projects every now and then. I am a fan
of most types of books, so if you have an recommendations, please send them my way.

I originally started this blog to explore all things data science, but have decided to broaden my
topics. I will try to expore more in that are, but I have also found other interests.

Checkout my resume [here][resume].

I love the outdoors, particularly water sports and hiking. I also like exercising and
occassionally playing land sports, too.
