Born in Mexico City, raised in Cancun and graduated from [Bowdoin College][bowdoin].

I have professional experience with Scala and breathe functional programming in my day to day job.
In my spare time you will see me dabble in IoT and hardware projects every now and then. I studied
math and computer science in college and I'm a fan of reading math books (or ficiton as well) so
if you have any recommendations, please send them my way!

I originally started this blog to explore all things data science, but have decided to broaden my topics,
not saying that i won't explore any other data sets but that is not all I'll do.

Checkout my resume [here][resume].

I love the outdoors, particularly water sports and hiking. I also like exercising and
occassionally playing land sports, too.
