Born in Mexico City, raised in Cancun and graduated from [Bowdoin College](http://www.bowdoin.edu).
I currently live in Florida but seeking to relocate to a major tech hub.

I have experience with C++, Java and Python, and I am gaining experience with HTML, CSS
Javascript, SQL and other fun things. I am particularly interested in all things related to
Data Science and analyzing people's motivations and behavior with data.

I love the outdoors, particularly water sports and hiking. I also like exercising and
occassionally playing land sports, soccer mostly.
